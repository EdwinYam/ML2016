These are the assignments for the machine learning course which I took at National Taiwan University. The class was lectured by professor Hung-yi Lee. Each homework was aimed at implementing one particular machine learning method.

* Homework 1 is to use linear regression to predict PM2.5 value
* Homework 2 is to use logistic regression to make prediction
* Homework 3 is to use semi-supervised learning for training on small dataset 
* Homework 4 is to use word-embedding with cosine similarity to classify
  documents
* Final project is to predict the most likely ads that would be clicked by users
